The Hopf fibration

**S**<sup>1</sup> ↪  **S**<sup>3</sup> ↠ **S**<sup>2</sup>

is a canonical nontrivial circle bundle over the 2-sphere **S**<sup>2</sup> whose total space is the 3-sphere **S**<sup>3</sup>.

This [interactive demonstration](https://nasosev.github.io/hopf_fibration) allows the Hopf fibration to be visualised.

The left-hand camera shows the 2-sphere **S**<sup>2</sup> with marked points depicted by coloured pins.

The right hand-camera shows a stereographic projection of the fibres corresponding to these marked points in the 3-sphere **S**<sup>3</sup> onto the unit ball **D**<sup>3</sup> ⊂ **R**<sup>3</sup>.

Any two of these circular fibres are interlinked.

See <https://nilesjohnson.net/hopf-production.html> for details of the projection, or <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_fibration> for general information about the Hopf fibration.
