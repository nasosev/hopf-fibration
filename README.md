The Hopf fibration

**S**<sup>1</sup> ↪  **S**<sup>3</sup> ↠ **S**<sup>2</sup>

is a canonical nontrivial circle bundle over the 2-sphere **S**<sup>2</sup> whose total space is the 3-sphere **S**<sup>3</sup>.

It is one of the few beautiful objects in topology that can be easily visualised.

The left-hand frame shows the 2-sphere **S**<sup>2</sup> with marked points depicted by coloured pins.

The right-hand frame shows a stereographic projection of the fibres corresponding to these marked points onto the unit ball **D**<sup>3</sup> ⊂ **R**<sup>3</sup>.

Any two of these circular fibres are interlinked.

See [nilesjohnson.net](https://nilesjohnson.net/hopf-production.html) for precise details of the projection, or [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_fibration) for general information.
